# CODE CHALLENGE 

This program should run from the command line, using NodeJs.

Write a "calculate" function that receives a string of math operations:

calculate(input:str) -> str

For example, calculate("12 * 2") should return "12 * 2 = 24"

Assume that valid input strings are composed entirely of valid equations consisting of integer numbers, a single space between numbers and operators, and the following operators: + , -, * (multiply)
